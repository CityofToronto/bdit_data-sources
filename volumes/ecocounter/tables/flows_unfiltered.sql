'CAUTION: Use VIEW `ecocounter.flows` which includes only flows verified by a human. '
'A flow is usually a direction of travel associated with a sensor at '
'an ecocounter installation site. For earlier sensors that did not detect '
'directed flows, a flow may be both directions of travel together, i.e. '
'just everyone who passed over the sensor any which way.';

'the second indicates the normal direction of travel over that sensor relative to the '
