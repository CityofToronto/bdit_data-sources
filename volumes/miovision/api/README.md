## Miovision API

Miovision has provided an API for us to query data streaming from its cameras. This is how to use it.

### API Key

Emailed from Miovision. Keep it secret. Keep it safe.

### Relevant calls

Each of these returns a 1-minute aggregate, maximum 48-hrs of data, with a two-hour lag (the end time for the query cannot be more recent than two-hours before the query).

#### Turning Movement Count (TMC)

Every movement through the intersection except for pedestrians.

Response:

```json

    "exit": {'type':"string",'desc': "Exit leg, e.g. 'W'"},
    "qty": {'type':"int", 'desc': "Count of this movement/class combination"}
