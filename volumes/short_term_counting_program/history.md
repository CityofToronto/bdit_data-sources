# TMCs through the years

The short-term counting program has been running for a very long time, with TMCs in our database dating all the way back to 1985. Over the decades, many things have changed about what we count and how we count it.

## Bikes

* Prior to 1994, bikes were not counted at all, though they may appear in the database as counts of `0` rather than `null` values. 
* From 1994 to 2014, bikes were only counted some of the time. Again, we have `0`s instead of `null`s and caution is required. It appears however that _most_ counts in this period count at least one bike.
* From 2014 onward, bikes were alway counted in TMCs and zero values, where they exist, should be taken at face value.
* For counts conducted from September 2023 on, the bike count includes bicycles on the road riding into the intersection plus bicycles riding in the adjacent crosswalk area. (can we positively say these were not counted before?)
* At some point recently we began receiving full bicycle turning movements, like what we've always had for motor vehicles. These are not yet entering the database, but they're available by request and there are plans to bring them into the database.
