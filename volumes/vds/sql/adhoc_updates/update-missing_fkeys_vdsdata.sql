You will need to follow this adhoc process if you discover records in raw_vdsdata
that are missing vdsconfig_uid or entity_locations_uid foreign keys, in order to
add fkeys and then summarize those records in to counts_15min, counts_15min_bylane. 

This particular case occured when raw table was backfilled without latest lookups.
