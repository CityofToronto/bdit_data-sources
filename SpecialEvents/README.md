### AddressFunctions.py
Contains 3 utility functions:
1. FormatAddress(address)  
	This function takes in an address and formats it to its short form and strips punctuation and redundant characters. 
	Example: Takes '118 O'Connor Street, Toronto, ON, Canada' and returns '118 OConnor St'
	If the address is not in the form of 'street number + street name' will return the input address.
	
2. geocode(address)  
	Send address to Google Geocoding API and returns the formatted full address(street number, street name, city, province, country, postal code), latitude and longitude tuple.
	
3. rev_geocode(coordinates)  
	Send the coordinates to Google Geocoding API and returns the address in both the short form and the formatted full form.
