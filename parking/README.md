# Parking

This appears to describe the structure of the `parking` schema, which in turns seems to be a now outdated copy of datasets pulled from OpenData. It is unclear if this data is being maintained or used for any purposes within our unit. 

If we needed this data again, it would likely be a good idea to start from scratch rather than verify the integrity of the data aleady stored here.
