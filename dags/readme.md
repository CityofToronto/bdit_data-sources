# Airflow

Insert stuff about how awesome it is

## Deploying an Airflow Script on Our EC2

Our instance of Airflow runs as its own user `airflow` which resides in `/etc/airflow`. In order to ensure the code running on Airflow to be in sync with the code in GitHub, we have developed a unique folder structure. The important folders are:

- `/etc/airflow/dags`: for DAGs. In order for them to be synced to their files in `git`, it is preferable to symbolically link from this folder to the respective `dags` folder in the following two folders. For ex: while in `/etc/airflow/dags` run `ln -sf /etc/airflow/data_scripts/dags/pull_here.py .`
- `/etc/airflow/data_scripts`: a copy of this repository at the `master` branch
- `/etc/airflow/dev_scripts`: a copy of this repository on its branch, into which users `git pull` their development branches. **Never ever ever ever `git push` from this folder**

A [workaround](https://groups.google.com/g/cloud-composer-discuss/c/qWdaXZx-cuw/m/iMIdQClaCAAJ) is to 
going to 'Browse' -> 'Task Instances' -> check the instances that you want to clear -> With selected -> clear.
