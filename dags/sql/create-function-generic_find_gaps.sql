COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.generic_find_gaps
IS '''A generic find_gaps function to find gaps in sensor data.
Includes a lookback of `gap_threshold` so it catches gaps overlapping the start of the interval.
Includes synthetic start/end time points for all sensors so we catch gaps that don''t start or don''t end in the interval.
Doesn''t catch sensors with no data in the interval.''';
