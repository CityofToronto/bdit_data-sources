# BDIT Data Sources

This is a master repo for all of the data sources that we use. Each folder is for a different data source and contains an explanation of what the data source is and how it can be used, a sample of the data, and scripts to import the data into the PostgreSQL database.

## Open Data Releases

- [Travel Times - Bluetooth](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#4c1f1f4d-4394-8b47-bf00-262b6800ba81) contains data for all the bluetooth segments collected by the city. The travel times are 5 minute average travel times. The real-time feed is currently not operational. See [the Bluetooth README](bluetooth#8-open-data-releases) for more info.

For the [King St. Transit Pilot](toronto.ca/kingstreetpilot), the team has released the following datasets, which are typically a subset of larger datasets specific to the pilot:

- [King St. Transit Pilot - Detailed Bluetooth Travel Time](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#739f4e47-737c-1b32-3a0b-45f80e8c2951) contains travel times collected during the King Street Pilot in the same format as the above data set. Data is collected on segments found in the [King St. Transit Pilot – Bluetooth Travel Time Segments](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#54e5b29a-9171-1855-de16-59c7f4909eea) map layer. See [the Bluetooth README](bluetooth#8-open-data-releases) for more info.
- [King St. Transit Pilot – Bluetooth Travel Time Summary](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a85f193a-4910-f155-6cb9-49f9dedd1392) contains monthly averages of corridor-level travel times by time periods. See [the Bluetooth README](bluetooth#8-open-data-releases) for more info.
- [King St. Transit Pilot - 2015 King Street Traffic Counts](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#23c0a4a8-12f6-5ca7-9710-a5cf29a0a3e7) contains 15 minute aggregated ATR data collected during 2015 of various locations on King Street. See the [Volumes Open Data King Street Pilot](volumes#king-street-pilot) section for more info.
- [King St. Transit Pilot – Detailed Traffic & Pedestrian Volumes](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#55a44849-90eb-ed1e-fbca-a7ad6b1025e3) contains 15 minute aggregated TMC data collected from Miovision cameras during the King Street Pilot. The counts occurred at 31-32 locations at or around the King Street Pilot Area. See the [Miovision Open Data](miovision#open-data) section for more info.
- [King St. Transit Pilot - Traffic & Pedestrian Volumes Summary](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#dfd63698-5d0e-3d24-0732-9d1fea58523c) is a monthly summary of the above data, only including peak period and east-west data. The data in this dataset goes into the [King Street Pilot Dashboard](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/king-street-pilot/data-reports-background-materials/). See the [Miovision Open Data](miovision#open-data) section for more info.

## INRIX

### Data Elements

Field Name|Description|Type
----------|-----------|----
RoadName/Number|Road names or numbers|string
tx|Date and time|datetime
tmc|TMC Link ID|string
spd|Link speed estimate|double
count|Sample Size Used|int
score|Quality Indicator|10/20/30

### Notes

* INRIX vehicles disproportionately include heavy vehicles.
* There's additional sampling bias in that the heavy vehicles do not reflect the general travel patterns.
* Two sections of freeway(the southernmost sections of 427 and 404) have no available data. These approaches may be imssing due to the idiosyncratic geometries of TMCs near the major freeway-to-freeway interchanges.
* In any given 15 minute interval between 5am and 10pm, 88.7% of freeway links and 48% of arterial links have observations.

## Assets
The `assets` directory stores [airflow](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_team_wiki/blob/master/install_instructions/airflow.md) processes related to various assets that we help manage, such as datasets related to Vision Zero.  Below are the assets that we have automated so far.  

### Traffic Signals
Traffic-related indicators (Leading Pedestrian Intervals, Audible Pedestrian Signals, Pedestrian Crossovers, Traffic Signals, and LED Blankout Signs) are obtained from several different tables in the SignalView Oracle database. These indicators are used to populate the Vision Zero map and dashboard. We have developed a process using Airflow to automatically connect to the database, extract the data needed, and store to our RDS Postgres database. See the README file in `assets/traffic_signals` for details about the source datasets and how they are combined into a final table made up of the following data elements.   

#### Data Elements
Field Name|Description|Type
----------|-----------|----
asset_type|type of indicator|text
px|?? | integer
main_street|name of main street|text
midblock_route|location details e.g. "26m SOUTH OF" |text
side1_street|name of intersecting street |text
side2_street|name of intersecting street if it e.g. changes after intersection |text
latitude|latitude|numeric
longitude|longitude|numeric
activation_date|date installed |date
details|currently NULL |text  

#### Notes  
For the final layer `vz_safety_programs.points_traffic_signals`, the `asset_type` column is populated with text `Traffic Signals`, and the other columns are renamed:  

```
'Traffic Signals'::text AS asset_type,
   a.id::integer AS px,
   a.streetname AS main_street,
   a.midblockroute AS midblock_route,
   a.side1routef AS side1_street,
   a.side2route AS side2_street,
   b.latitude,
   b.longitude,
   b.activation_date AS activation_date,
   NULL::text AS details
```

### Red Light Cameras
Red Light Camera data are obtained from Open Data and are also indicators that are displayed on the Vision Zero map and dashboard. We have developed a process using Airflow to automatically connect to Open Data and store the data to our RDS Postgres database. See the README file in `assets/rlc` for details about this process.  The final table is made up of the following elements:  

#### Data Elements
Field Name|Description|Type
----------|-----------|----
rlc|ID number of camera |integer
tcs|?|integer
loc|name of intersection|text
additional_info| notes |text
main|name of main street in intersection|text
side1|name of intersecting street|text
side2|name of intersecting street if it e.g. changes after intersection |text
mid_block|currently all NULL|text
privateAccess|name of private access street|text
latitude|latitude|numeric
longitude|longitude|numeric
x|?|numeric
y|?|numeric
district|name of district|text
ward1|?|text
ward2|?|text
ward3|?|text
ward4|?|text
policeDivision1|?|text
policeDivision2|?|text
policeDivision3	|?|text
