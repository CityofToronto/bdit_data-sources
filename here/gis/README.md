# HERE GIS Data

Here GIS data is provided through the Enterprise Data Download portal. Each Revision contains ~41 layers provided for the province of Ontario. Consult the encyclopedic `NAVSTREETS Street Data Reference Manual.pdf` in the K drive for further info on a layer.

## Loading New Data

After downloading to the EC2, uncompress and un-tar the file with the below command. Some versions of this download included all provinces. Each province folder within the tar contains another compressed tar for that folder. Ontario's folder starts with `2E` (from `"Region Code: 2E"`).

```shell
# List the contents of the tar to identify the Ontario folder starting with 2E
tar --exclude="*/*/*" -tf HERE_GIS_DATA.tar
mkdir HERE_GIS_DATA_R/
#the 2E* wildcard should probably work
tar --wildcards "2E*/*" -xf HERE_GIS_DATA.tar -C HERE_GIS_DATA_R/
```

## Importing New GIS layers

There are three shapefiles in the unzipped folder that we need to import:
1) `Streets.shp`` - Shapefile of all new here links
2) `Zlevels.shp`` - Zlevels of all new nodes
3) `Adminbndy3.shp`` - Admin boundary of municipalities

### Current way of importing 

[`batch_upload.sh`](batch_upload.sh) shell script loops over the three shapefiles, and directly import the layers into the `here_gis` schema using `ogr2ogr`. `ogr2ogr` allows direct import from zipped or compressed files using `vsitar`. Note that this shortened use of `psql` assumes the current Ubuntu username and that the password for that user is stored in a [`.pgpass`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html) file in your home directory. Edit the `rev` variable at the start to specify the revision of the geographies. This will be appended to the uploaded tables' names.

Prior to running `ogr2ogr` the script performs some manipulation of the `$f` filename variable in order to lowercase it and remove the `.shp` string to turn it into a compatible tablename for PostgreSQL. Tables are versioned by appending `YY_R` to their names where YY is the year and R is the revision number.

After the data is loaded, `psql` is called again to alter each table's owner to the here_admins group and then run [`here_gis.clip_to(tablename, revision)`](clip_to.sql) to clip the layer to within the City's boundary. `Adminbndy3` layer will be imported first as we use the Toronto municipalites boundary defined in this layer for clipping purposes.

Subsequently [`split_streets_att.sql`](split_streets_att.sql) can be run to split the streets layer into a GIS layer and an attributes table (there are a lot of columns in the attributes table) in order to reduce the size of the streets layer when loading it in QGIS.


```shell
nohup bash batch_upload.sh > batch_upload.log& tail -f batch_upload.log
```

**Note:** Please add a [`COMMENT`](https://devdocs.io/postgresql~9.6/sql-comment) to the `streets_YY_R` layer explaining which years of traffic data should use that layer.


### Derivative gis layers to update

There are a few additional things to create based on the new map layer:

- [`function_create_routing_tables.sql`](sql/function_create_routing_tables.sql): creates routing nodes, traffic streets, and routing streets layers. Run `SELECT here.function_create_routing_tables(ref_yr)` to create layers.
- `here_gis.traffic_streets`

## Reference Node

Links are defined by a reference node, and a non-reference node. The reference
node is *always* the node with the lowest latitude, in the case of two nodes
with equal latitude, the node with the lowest longitude is the reference node.
This impacts things like traffic direction, which can be towards or from a
reference node, or addressing whether addresses are on the right or left side
of a link (facing the non-reference node).
