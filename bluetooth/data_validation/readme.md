# Bluetooth Data Validation

This folder contains jupyter notebooks of explorations performed to validate the data we receive from bluetooth sniffers.

- [`class_of_device.ipynb`](class_of_device.ipynb): Looks at differences in observations by the different device_classes
- [`cod_vs_DeviceClass.ipynb`](cod_vs_DeviceClass.ipynb): Compares those two columns to determine their relationship
- [`gardiner_directional_observations.ipynb`](gardiner_directional_observations.ipynb): Looks at the difference in number of observations in different directions along the Gardiner elevated expressway.
