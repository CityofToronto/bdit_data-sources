# Updating Bluetooth Segments

## Overview

Ocasionally, new segments need to be added to the `bluetooth` schema. This document will go over the steps and the general process to add new routes along the newly installed bluetooth reader locations. It assumes that `bluetooth.all_analyses` table does not have rows already created for the proposed new routes. The steps listed here are followed to create an entirely new routes for newly installed bluetooth readers in the city.

## Data Updating

In this update, there exists an Excel Sheet template that contains details of newly added bluetooth detectors. The details include proposed routes `Name`, `Description`, intersection name as `Name` (according to BDIT convention), four digit bluetooth sensor identification number  as `Sensor` and `latitude/longitude` at start point and the end points along with numerous other fields. Below is the template screenshot.

This template was used to include all the details of the routes that can be useful for future analysis. The routes that were updated by adding this batch of new detectors were named with a prefix "DT3_" . 

## Adding Readers

New readers were added manually in the Excel template and saved as .csv file. In addition to the lat/lon, the street names at each intersection where the readers are located is also needed in two columns for each route as the `from_street` and `to_street`. The `Description` field contains this information. For each proposed route, the excel sheet is populated and assigned a unique `analysis_id`. For this batch of new readers, analysis id starting from 1600000 with increment of 10 were added. 

Therefore the new reader table had the following fields populated: 

`analysis_id` 		- Unique ID for each route
`street` 			- Name of the street along the route
`direction` 		- Route direction(East bound, West Bound, North Bound or South Bound)
`from_street` 		- Name of the intersecting street where the route begins.
`to_street`			- Name of the intersecting street where the route ends 
`from_name`			- The reader name (bdit convention) at the start point of the route
`from_id` 			- The four digit Unique bluetooth id at the start point
`from_lat` 			- Latitude at the start point of the route
`from_lon` 			- Longitude at the start point of the route
`to_name` 			- The reader name (bdit convention) at the end point of the route
`to_id`				- The four digit Unique bluetooth id at the end point
`to_lat`			- Latitude at the end point of the route
`to_lon`			- Longitude at the end point of the route

Below is the table screenshot.

## Preparatory Tables and Steps
The following steps are utilized to create segments
1. Get start and end geom for each analysis_id
2. Create table with detector_id, detector_geom, centreline_int_id
3. Join the detector's geometry to the closest centreline intersection
4. Route the segments using street centreline's intersection `gis.centreline_both_dir` using [pgr_dijkstra].


This .csv file was then imported into QGIS and pushed into the mohan schema in postgres. The geometry column is created by adding a column using `ALTER TABLE mohan.new_added_detectors ADD COLUMN from_geom GEOMETRY` we need two geometry columns: `from_geom` and `to_geom`.  Filling in the from_geom column with `UPDATE mohan.new_added_detectors SET to_geom = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(to_lon, to_lat), 4326)` and modify the query for `from_geom`.

## Finding Nearest Intersection IDs

To get the intersection ids that are close to the newly added detectors location, create a table named `bluetooth_nodes`. This table has four fields:
`bluetooth_id`, `geom` (this is geometry of bluetooth detectors), `int_id` (nearest intersection id) and `int_geom` (geometry of the nearest intersection to the )

This table is created using the following query:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE mohan.bluetooth_nodes AS(
SELECT DISTINCT mohan.new_added_detectors.from_id::integer AS bluetooth_id,
    mohan.new_added_detectors.from_geom,
    nodes.int_id,
    st_transform(nodes.node_geom, 4326) AS int_geom
   FROM mohan.new_added_detectors
     CROSS JOIN LATERAL ( SELECT z.int_id,
            st_transform(z.geom, 98012) AS node_geom
           FROM gis.centreline_intersection z
          ORDER BY (z.geom <-> mohan.new_added_detectors.from_geom)
         LIMIT 1) nodes);
```
Check that correct intersections are returned from this query especially for oblique intersections with an offset. If required, correct the intersection_id and geom for such intersections and finalize the table `mohan.bluetooth_nodes`. An example is shown below. The intersection between Dundas St W, Roncesvalles Ave and Boustead Ave is oblique with an offset. The BT reader 5263 (red dot) picked up intersection_id `13466305` (greed dot) as nearest intersection to the reader. But the planned route does not go through this intersection_id. The correct intersection_id for this reader is `113466258`. The intersection_id and geom for this redear was therefore corrected manually.

## Using pg_routing
Once the nearest centreline intersection nodes are linked to the bluetooth readers geom `mohan.bluetooth_nodes`, we are ready to run the following Query to create new routes. 

```SQL
CREATE table mohan.bt_segments_new AS (
WITH lookup AS (
SELECT analysis_id, from_id, origin.int_id AS source, to_id, dest.int_id AS target
FROM mohan.new_added_detectors 
INNER JOIN mohan.bluetooth_nodes origin ON from_id = origin.bluetooth_id 
INNER JOIN mohan.bluetooth_nodes dest ON to_id = dest.bluetooth_id
),
results AS (
	SELECT * 
	FROM lookup
			 CROSS JOIN LATERAL pgr_dijkstra('SELECT id, source, target, cost FROM gis.centreline_routing_directional inner join gis.centreline on geo_id = id
where fcode != 207001', source::int, target::int, TRUE)		 
), 
lines as (
	SELECT analysis_id, street, direction, from_street, to_street, edge AS geo_id, geom 
	FROM results			 
INNER JOIN gis.centreline ON edge=geo_id
INNER JOIN mohan.new_added_detectors USING (analysis_id)
ORDER BY analysis_id
)
SELECT analysis_id, street, direction, from_street, to_street,
	CASE WHEN geom_dir != direction THEN ST_reverse(geom) 
	ELSE geom 
	END AS 
	geom
FROM ( 
SELECT analysis_id, street, direction, from_street, to_street, 
		gis.twochar_direction(gis.direction_from_line(ST_linemerge(ST_union(geom)))) AS geom_dir,
		ST_linemerge(ST_union(geom)) AS geom
FROM lines
GROUP BY analysis_id, street, direction, from_street, to_street) a)
```

## Things to note 
Geostatistical lines and planning boundaries need to be avoided while pgrouting. 

## Validating Output
Validate the length of the segments with length ST_length(geom) and direction using gis.direction_from_line(geom) functions.If the detectors are located very close to the centerline intersections, it is not necessary to do the  centreline cutting. If any bluetooth detectors are not located at the start or end point of a centreline, we will need to cut the centreline using ST_linelocatepoint() as explained in [here.](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_data-sources/issues/234) . 

The new routes table is now ready to append to the existing routes table.
