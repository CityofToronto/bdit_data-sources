# Traffic Signals dataset

This is one of the datasets managed by the Traffic Control group. The owner is Rajnath Bissessar. Data is updated by automatic feed in Traffic Control and stored in their Oracle database. The idea here is to set up an airflow process to automatically extract Traffic Signal data from the Oracle database and create a view that can be served to other applications e.g. Vision Zero.
