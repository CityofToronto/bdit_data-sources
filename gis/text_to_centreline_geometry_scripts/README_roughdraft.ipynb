    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a `README` for the `text_to_centreline(highway, fr, t)` function, which is written in `postgresql` (currently living in the `crosic` schema). The general purpose of this function is to take input of a text description of a street location in the City of Toronto, and make an output of centreline segments that match this description. The input descriptions typically state the street that the bylaw occurs on and the two intersections between which the bylaw occrus. For example, you could use the function to get the centreline segments of Bloor Street between Royal York Road and St George Street.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is supposed to be mainly used for City of Toronto [transportation bylaw data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-and-parking-by-law-schedules/), for example we have already used previous versions of this process for [posted speed limits](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_data-sources/tree/master/gis/posted_speed_limit_update) on streets in the City, locations of [community safety zones](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_vz_programs/tree/master/safety_zones/commuity_safety_zone_bylaws), [turn restrictions](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_vz_programs/blob/master/notebooks/Turn%20Restrictions.ipynb), etc. The function can handle most bylaws, even more advanced cases. Any limitations that we are currently aware of will be listed somewhere in this document. It also should be noted that some bylaws are incorrect (for many reasons, such as a described intersection not existing), and our function probably cannot match a lot of these bylaws, since the data is incorrect.

    "3. `metres_btwn1` and `metres_btwn2`: will be null for everything except for [special case 1 and 2](#Special-Cases). These are the number of metres away from the intersections (intersections meaning intersection of `highway2` and `btwn1` and/or `highway2` and `btwn2`) that the bylaws occur\n",
    "4. `direction_btwn1` and `direction_btwn2`: will be null for everything except for [special case 1 and 2](#Special-Cases). These are directions away from the intersections (intersections meaning intersection of `highway2` and `btwn1` and/or `highway2` and `btwn2`) that the bylaws occur\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different cases for how the data is input ([see above](#Function-Inputs)), so both of those cases should have to be cleaned differently, hence there is a lot of code like: `CASE WHEN t IS NULL THEN ` .... `ELSE`. An idea to make this cleaner in the future could be to make 2 different functions for cleaning inputs. \n",

    "## Step 2: Match the location text data to intersections\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `get_intersection_geom` is the main function that is called to get the geometry of the intersections between which the bylaw is in effect. The function returns an array with the geometry of the intersection and the `objectid` (unique `ID`) of the intersection. If the `direction` and `metres` values that are inputted to the function are not `NULL`, then the function returns a translated intersection geometry (translated in the direction specified by the number of metres specified). The function takes a value `not_int_id` as an input. This is an intersection `int_id` (intersection `ID`) that we do not want the function to return. We use `int_id` instead of `objectid` since sometimes there are intersection points that are in the exact same location but have different `objectid` values. This is a parameter to this function because sometimes streets can intersect more than once, and we do not want the algorithm to match to the same intersection twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "In  most cases, the function `get_intersection_geom` calls on another function called `get_intersection_id`. This function returns the `objectid` and `intersection id` of the intersection, as well as how close the match was (where closeness is measured by levenshtein distance). The query in this function works by gathering all of the streets from the City of Toronto intersection streets table that have the same/very similar names to the streets that intersect each other to create an end point of the bylaw location. If there are more than one street with the same unique intersection ID in this subset, then this means that both streets in the enpoint of the bylaw have been matched to streets in the City of Toronto intersection. We can use a `HAVING` clause (i.e. `HAVING COUNT(intersections.street) > 1`) to ensure that only the intersections that have been matched to both street names are chosen. The `gis.centreline_intersection_streets` view (that is called in this query) assigns a unique ID to each intersection in the City of Toronto (`gis.centreline_intersection`). Each row contains one street name from an intersection and the ID associated with the intersection. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the names for `highway` and `btwn` are the same, the `get_intersection_geom` calls on the function called `get_intersection_id_highway_equals_btwn`. This function is intended for cases where the intersection that we want is a cul de sac or a dead end or a pseudo intersection. In these cases the intersection would just be the name of the street. `not_int_id` is a parameter of this function as well since some streets both start and end with an intersection that is a cul de sac or pseudo intersection. The process to find the appropriate intersection is very similar to the `get_intersection_id` function, except it does not have the `HAVING COUNT(intersections.street) > 1`. This is because cul de sac or pseudo intersections intersection only have one entry in the `gis.centreline_intersection_streets` view (since there is only one road involved in the intersection).\n",

To find the fraction that the point x metres away from the original intersection was located, I calculated the fraction of the line that the location the specified intersection represented.
