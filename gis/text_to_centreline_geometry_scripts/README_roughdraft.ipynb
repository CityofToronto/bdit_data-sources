    "\n",
    "This is a `README` for the `text_to_centreline(highway, fr, t)` function, which is written in `postgresql` (currently living in the `crosic` schema). The general purpose of this function is to take input of a text description of a street location in the City of Toronto, and make an output of centreline segments that match this description. The input descriptions typically state the street that the bylaw occurs on and the two intersections between which the bylaw occrus. For example, you could use the function to get the centreline segments of Bloor Street between Royal York Road and St George Street.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is supposed to be mainly used for City of Toronto [transportation bylaw data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-and-parking-by-law-schedules/), for example we have already used previous versions of this process for [posted speed limits](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_data-sources/tree/master/gis/posted_speed_limit_update) on streets in the City, locations of [community safety zones](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_vz_programs/tree/master/safety_zones/commuity_safety_zone_bylaws), [turn restrictions](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_vz_programs/blob/master/notebooks/Turn%20Restrictions.ipynb), etc. The function can handle most bylaws, even more advanced cases. Any limitations that we are currently aware of will be listed somewhere in this document. It also should be noted that some bylaws are incorrect (for many reasons, such as a described intersection not existing), and our function probably cannot match a lot of these bylaws, since the data is incorrect.

    "\n",
    "The function `get_intersection_geom` is the main function that is called to get the geometry of the intersections between which the bylaw is in effect. The function returns an array with the geometry of the intersection and the `objectid` (unique `ID`) of the intersection. If the `direction` and `metres` values that are inputted to the function are not `NULL`, then the function returns a translated intersection geometry (translated in the direction specified by the number of metres specified). The function takes a value `not_int_id` as an input. This is an intersection `int_id` (intersection `ID`) that we do not want the function to return. We use `int_id` instead of `objectid` since sometimes there are intersection points that are in the exact same location but have different `objectid` values. This is a parameter to this function because sometimes streets can intersect more than once, and we do not want the algorithm to match to the same intersection twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "In  most cases, the function `get_intersection_geom` calls on another function called `get_intersection_id`. This function returns the `objectid` and `intersection id` of the intersection, as well as how close the match was (where closeness is measured by levenshtein distance). The query in this function works by gathering all of the streets from the City of Toronto intersection streets table that have the same/very similar names to the streets that intersect each other to create an end point of the bylaw location. If there are more than one street with the same unique intersection ID in this subset, then this means that both streets in the enpoint of the bylaw have been matched to streets in the City of Toronto intersection. We can use a `HAVING` clause (i.e. `HAVING COUNT(intersections.street) > 1`) to ensure that only the intersections that have been matched to both street names are chosen. The `gis.centreline_intersection_streets` view (that is called in this query) assigns a unique ID to each intersection in the City of Toronto (`gis.centreline_intersection`). Each row contains one street name from an intersection and the ID associated with the intersection. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the names for `highway` and `btwn` are the same, the `get_intersection_geom` calls on the function called `get_intersection_id_highway_equals_btwn`. This function is intended for cases where the intersection that we want is a cul de sac or a dead end or a pseudo intersection. In these cases the intersection would just be the name of the street. `not_int_id` is a parameter of this function as well since some streets both start and end with an intersection that is a cul de sac or pseudo intersection. The process to find the appropriate intersection is very similar to the `get_intersection_id` function, except it does not have the `HAVING COUNT(intersections.street) > 1`. This is because cul de sac or pseudo intersections intersection only have one entry in the `gis.centreline_intersection_streets` view (since there is only one road involved in the intersection).\n",

    "### Match line to centreline: \n",
    "\n",
    "Main Steps: \n",
    "1. Create a large buffer around the `line_geom` \n",
    "2. Select centreline segments from `gis.centreline` that have the right name that are inside of the buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the name of the street in the `gis.centreline` table is not the same as the name that is imputted to the `text_to_centreline` function and processed into `highway2`. Also, sometimes streets with names that are very similar to each other exist very close to each other. So it is very important to first figure out how the street name is represented in the `gis.centreline` table. Thus, the first thing that the `match_line_to_centreline` function does is find one single street name that is closest to the `highway2` name, that is within the buffer. This is done by first selecting all of the streets within the buffer that  have a very similar (if not exactly the same) street name (i.e. segments with street names with a [Levenshtein distance](https://www.cuelogic.com/blog/the-levenshtein-algorithm/) of less than 3). They are put into the array in order of how close they are to the `highway2` name. The array is called `street_name_arr` and is created as a way to QC the matched later on. The first values of the array is saved as the `street_name` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `match_line_to_centreline` function matches `line_geom` to centreline segments. If both `metres_btwn1` and `metres_btwn2` are `NULL`, it does this by creating a buffer that is 3 times the length of `line_geom` around `line_geom`. It then catches all of the segments in that buffer that have the same name as `street_name` where more than 90% of the segment is within the buffer. \n",
    "\n",
    "If `metres_btwn2` and/or `metres_btwn1` is not `NULL` than the buffer length is `10` times the value of `COALESCE(metres_btwn1, metres_btwn2)` and the centreline segment can be within `30` metres of the end of the buffer. Also, this case does not require the 90% of the centreline segments to intersect with the buffer. The reason why there is a 30 metre extension at the end of the buffer/`line_geom` and there is no `90%` rule in the case where `metres_btwn1` or `metres_btwn2` are not `NULL` is because we want to include the street segments that intersect with the intersections that are not inside of our originally drawn buffer. The type of buffer we are using in both cases has a flat endcap. This means that that the buffer does not go farther than the end of `line_geom`. This type of buffer is useful in the case where `metres_btwn1` and `metres_btwn2` are `NULL` because it prevents additional centreline segments that are part of the same street and are beside each intersection (but not inside the buffer) from being included in the selected centreline segments. However, in the case where `metres_btwn1` and/or `metres_btwn2` are not `NULL`, the final geometry might extend beyond the intersection (see documentation on [special case 1 and 2](#Special-Cases) for more information). So we would like to select all segments along the street that are between the two intersections, and also segments that intersect with the ends of the buffer (i.e. `oid1_geom` and `oid2_geom`). The `30` metres buffer ensures that segments that are near the intersections but just slightly out of the buffer are also selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "### centreline_segments variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `text_to_centreline` function, this variable is the final version of the geometry that represents the location between the two intersections. There are a few cases for how to get the final geometry from the `match_line_to_centreline` geometry: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the bylaw occurs on the entire length of the street then call a special function called `get_entire_length_centreline_segements`. This function selects all centreline segments in the City of Toronto with the exact name of `highway2`. In this case the street name has to be exact, and if the street name is misspelled then there will be no output geometry. There could potentially be an issue with how this code is written because some streets in the city have the same name but occur in different districts (i.e. Etobicoke and North York). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If `COALESCE(metres_btwn1, metres_btwn2) IS NULL` then the bylaw is not a [special case](#Special-Cases). So the centreline segments from `match_line_to_centreline` are the final output. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the bylaw is [special case](#Special-Cases) the call the appripriate function for that special case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence output\n",
    "\n",
    "The function outputs a confidence level (`con`), which is defined after the `centreline_segments` variable. This value represents how close the names of the input values are to the intersections they were matched to. Specifically, this value is the sum of the levenshtien distance between the `highway2` value and the street name it matched to and the `btwn1`/`btwn2` value and the street name it matched to. It is the sum of this value for both intersections. "
