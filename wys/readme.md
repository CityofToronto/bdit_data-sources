The city has installed [Watch Your Speed Signs](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/road-safety/vision-zero/safety-initiatives/initiatives/watch-your-speed-program/) that display the speed a vehicle is travelling at and flashes if the vehicle is travelling over the speed limit. Installation of the sign was done as part of 3 programs: the normal watch your speed sign program, mobile watch your speed which has signs mounted on trailers that move to a different location every few weeks, and school watch your speed which has signs installed at high priority schools. As part of the [Vision Zero Road Safety Plan](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/road-safety/vision-zero/), these signs aim to reduce speeding.
